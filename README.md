A program to track a single bus on its MIT-Harvard route in real time. A marker updates every 15 seconds to the current location of a Boston Bus. An exercise for 

- Async functionality 
- Access tokens 
- Mapboxgl 

## How to Run

1. Download index.html, mapAnimation.js, and styles.css into a single file onto your machine. 
2. Drag and Drop index.html onto your browser. 
3. It should load a dark themed map with a pink curser that will update its position every 15 seconds.
4. **note**: be patient! Its a real bus being tracked. If the bus is stopped, in traffic, or picking up passengers, the marker wont move until the bus is moving again.

## Future Updates

* Fill in rivers and roads with color.
* Indicate via marker color or a hover popup what fill capacity the bus is at
* Indicate via color what path the bus is on.
* Interactive element to choose which bus and its path to folow.
* Icons for busstops.
* Indicate the direction of the bus. 
* Make marker movement more seamless
